        <p>Moroland is more or less a broad region in the southern islands in the Philippines where ethnic Moros thrive in. They are predominantly muslims, with a culture blended with the past South-East Asian Hindu empires. </p>

        <p>Here in Moroland Blades, we are here to promote the martial culture of Moroland. We sell weapons commonly utilized by Moro warriors such as the Juramentados and more. From the Barong to the Kris, we sell their native blades and armor. </p>

        <p>We are associated with the Moro Culture altogether as much of your purchases will be sent to our Moro Blacksmiths in Mindanao and more. You buy our goods, and you indirectly help Moro culture to endure the test of time. We are here to preserve Moro Culture, and with your help, we will attain it together. </p>
